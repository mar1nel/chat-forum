# ü§ç React Interactive Comments Section

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\
Special thanks to [NextUI](https://nextui.org/) library for providing awesome UI components.

Coded by the silliest man alive: `mar1nel` 

## üïä The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this interactive comments section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

We provide the data in a local `data.json` file, so use that to populate the content on the first load. If you want to take it up a notch, feel free to build this as a full-stack CRUD application!

## üëÄ Your users should be able to:

![desktop-design](https://github.com/mar1nel/chat-forum/assets/110196455/1887e958-7a27-4ec5-9ae9-053a6cb59369)

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

## üîß Still in progress

I tried to mentain style, but design will be slighty different with a dose of personality

## üì£ Sharing your solution

There are multiple places you can share your solution:

1. Share your solution page in the **#finished-projects** channel of the [Slack community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/slack). 
2. Tweet [@frontendmentor](https://twitter.com/frontendmentor) and mention **@frontendmentor**, including the repo and live URLs in the tweet. We'd love to take a look at what you've built and help share it around.
3. Share your solution on other social channels like LinkedIn.
4. Blog about your experience building your project. Writing about your workflow, technical choices, and talking through your code is a brilliant way to reinforce what you've learned. Great platforms to write on are [dev.to](https://dev.to/), [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/), and [CodeNewbie](https://community.codenewbie.org/).

We provide templates to help you share your solution once you've submitted it on the platform. Please do edit them and include specific questions when you're looking for feedback. 

The more specific you are with your questions the more likely it is that another member of the community will give you feedback.
